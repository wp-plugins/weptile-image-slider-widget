Easily create responsive & lightweight image slider (rotator) widgets in any sidebar, post or page.

== Description ==

Weptile Image Slider Widget is a responsive, easy, lightweight image slider widget plugin integrating nivo slider script to any sidebar, post or page without any conflicts. 

You can add images to rotate in any sidebar. Arrange image order with drag & drop. You can also add links to each image.

The slider settings are all done within the widget. There are 16 widget settings including 16 animation options and 4 built in slider templates.

Change Log:
1.2.0
Moved the cache folder under uploads folder to prevent missing images after plugin update.

Improved UI with larger image, smaller buttons
Improved widget setting process
Added image target link, alt text, caption options
Added slider center align option
Added link, alt text, caption options to shortcode system
Changed the whole shortcode system to include the new additions.

Added Shortcode support for posts/pages
Fixed several bugs in widget update

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Add your "weptile image slider widget" to any sidebar from the 'Widgets' screen.
4. Setup the slider / rotator setting within the widget or use the shortcode in the post/page editor.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Can we use the slider in any sidebar?=
Yes.

= Can we use the slider in any page or post?=
Yes! (just added this in this update - more to follow)

= Can we add links to images? =
Yes.  You can add a different link for each image in each slider, as you like.

= Can we reorder images easily in the slider? =
Yes. You can drag and drop the images to reorder them easily.

= Can we easily edit options and reorder images within the widget? =
Yes. There are 16 options, 16 animation effects and you can drag the images to arrange order after you insert them to the widget.

= Can we use multiple widgets in the same sidebar? =
Yes. As many as you like.

= Can we use multiple widgets in the same page? =
Yes. As many as you like.

= Can we use the widgets in the same page where we have another nivo script running? =
Yes. It won't conflict with existing nivo scripts.

= Can we change the appearence of sliders? =
Yes. There are 4 out of the box themes for our slider widget. You can also add custom themes if you want. All you have to do is create a folder in your /plugins folder and name it as you like (for example: minimal-slider) and put your css and image files in it. In the widget options select that you want to specify a custom theme and write your own theme folder's name (for exmaple: minimal-slider). You can use any available theme css as your theme template to create a new one. One last thing, you must use your theme's name in your css file as a namespace with "theme" prefix (for example: .theme-minimal-slider{ ... } ).

= I can not see images in the slider =
If this error happened right after the plugin update, resave all widget settings and it'll be fixed once and forall.
Else, you might want to check your folder permissions for this plugins' cache folder under your uploads folder.
